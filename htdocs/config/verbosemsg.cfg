      You have used the element named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not define an element of that name.
      This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Frameset" document type to get the "&lt;frameset&gt;" element),
      or by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "&lt;spacer&gt;"
      or "&lt;marquee&gt;" (this is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve
      the desired effect instead).

      The Validator found an end tag for the above element, but that element is
      not currently open. This is often caused by a leftover end tag from an
      element that was removed during editing, or by an implicitly closed
      element (if you have an error related to an element beeing used where it
      is not allowed, this is almost certainly the case). In the latter case
      this error will disappear as soon as you fix the original problem.

      You have used a character that is not considered a "name character" in an
      attribute value. Which characters are considered "name characters" varies
      between the different document types, but a good rule of thumb is that
      unless the value contains <em>only</em> lower or upper case letters in the
      range a-z you must put quotation marks around the value. In fact, unless
      you have <em>extreme</em> file size requirements it is a very very good
      idea to <em>always</em> put quote marks around your attribute values. It
      is never wrong to do so, and very often it is absolutely necessary.

      error message? Then please let us know by sending a message to the <a
        href="mailto:www-validator@w3.org?Subject=[VE][108]%20New%20Error%20Message%20Suggestion"

    <p>
      You have used the attribute named above in your document, but the
      document type you are using does not support that attribute for this
      element. This error is often caused by incorrect use of the "Strict"
      document type with a document that uses frames (e.g. you must use
      the "Transitional" document type to get the "target" attribute), or
      by using vendor proprietary extensions such as "marginheight" (this
      is usually fixed by using CSS to achieve the desired effect instead).
    </p>
    <p>
      This error may also result if the element itself is not supported in
      the document type you are using, as an undefined element will have no
      supported attributes; in this case, see the element-undefined error
      message for further information.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to fix: check the spelling of the element and attribute, and/or 
      check that they are both allowed in the chosen document type, and/or
      use CSS instead of this attribute.

      The sequence &lt;FOO /&gt; can be interpreted in at least two different ways,
      depending on the DOCTYPE of the document. For HMTL 4.01 Strict, the '/'
      terminates the tag &lt;FOO (with an implied '&gt;').  However, since many
      browsers don't interpret it this way, even in the presence of an HMTL 4.01 Strict
     DOCTYPE, it is best to avoid it completely in pure HTML documents and 
     reserve its use solely for those written in XHTML.

      You've included a character reference to a character that is not defined
      in the document type you've chosen. This is most commonly caused by
      numerical references to characters from vendor proprietary
      character repertoires. Often the culprit will be fancy or typographical
      quote marks from either the Windows or Macintosh character repertoires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is to reference UNICODE characters instead. A list of
      common characters from the Windows character repertoire and their
      UNICODE equivalents can be found in the document "<a
