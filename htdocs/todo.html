    <p class="intro">
      This page has the to-do list for the <a href="/">W3C HTML Validation
      Service</a>, including bugs that need fixing and general wishlist items.
      See also the
      <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/">www-validator
        mailing list archives</a> for recent discussion that may not be
      reflected on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recently, we're trying something new. <code>:-)</code> We're going to
      start splitting development into "releases"; that is milestones with a
      version number. We've done a few allready, arbitrarily named 0.5.0 and
      0.5.1, that mainly existed as CVS tags to make bug fixing easier. Right
      now I'm trying to stretch this concept a little further by planning
      features for future versions in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a result, you will find several lists on this page now; one for each
      planned version and one for general "some time when I get a round tuit"
      stuff. As releases are made, the TODO items for that release
      <em>may</em> get moved to a separate "Changelog/Release Notes" page, but
      if lazyness wins out they may just stay here afterall. <code>:-)</code>

      <h2>Various Unclassified Stuff</h2>
      <p>
        These items are roughly in prioritized order; i.e. the items near the
        top are those which I consider most important.

      <ol>
        <li>Finish up the textarea for testing short HTML fragments.</li>
        <li>
          Add a "fix my HTML for me" option using <a

        </li>
        <li>
          Finish adding support for XML validation (see also:
          <a href="dev/tests/#xml">test cases</a>, or
          <a href="http://www.hcrc.ed.ac.uk/~richard/xml-check.html">an

        <li>

          automate the updates.

        <li>
          Make lists of "most frequently validated invalid pages"
          and "most frequently validated (non-W3C?) valid pages"
          (need to start logging stuff first, including IPs to compare
          uniqueness).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a section to the report on
          <a href="http://www.mnot.net/cacheability/">document cacheability</a>?
          (or just link to it?)
        </li>
        <li>
          Put the explanations in a database (flat files are probably okay),
          and offer an option to display them inline with the errors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install and play with HTML::Validator, link to it from somewhere:
          <a href="http://www.hut.fi/~samzait/HTML-Validator/">http://www.hut.fi/~samzait/HTML-Validator/</a>
          <a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SA/SAIT/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-authors/id/S/SA/SAIT/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          Write documentation, describing each feature and option of the
          validator and answering questions like "What's the difference between
          an SGML parser and Weblint?", "Which DOCTYPE should I use?",
          content negotiation, ...
        </li>
        <li>Incorporate CSS validation directly into this service.</li>
        <li>
          Make e.g. <code>http://validator.w3.org/check/referer;imgonly</code>
          return only an image showing the validation status of the referring
          page.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add link validation using Hugo's
          <a href="http://dev.w3.org/cvsweb/validator/httpd/cgi-bin/checklink.pl">checklink
          code</a> (or other code with similar functionality).
        </li>
        <li>
          Give errors/warnings related to markup that is technically valid SGML,
          but error prone, such as things found in
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/appendix/notes.html#h-B.3">"B.3
          SGML implementation notes"</a> in the
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/">HTML 4.0 spec</a>.
          (these things really belong in something like
          <a href="http://www.weblint.org/">weblint</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          Make an "elements found" section a la Webtechs, with links from each
          element to the appropriate place in either the DTD tree listing
          produced with dtd2html (after running dtd2html with all DTDs in the
          catalog), or the HTML 3.2/4.0 specs, or htmlhelp.com stuff, ...
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a "document meta-information" section to the report, to encourage
          people to use META tags appropriately?
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a "recommend a DTD for me" feature (check a document against all
          available DTDs, report which one has the fewest errors)
        </li>
        <li>
          Start caching validation results locally and doing an If-Modified-Since
          HTTP request to only download and re-validate URLs if they actually
          changed since their last validation
        </li>
        <li>
          Site walker/validator: need to add a "registered user" feature first,
          because this feature could be abused (many requests on a server in a
          short period of time)?
        </li>
        <li>
          URL-minder service: "remind me if this page or set of pages ever
          ceases to validate"
          <ul>
            <li>
              "registered user" feature is also necessary for this (to prevent
              unwanted e-mail)
            </li>
            <li>
              "registered users" could have a list of URLs they're interested in,
              and whenever they return to the service they can modify this list,
              and e-mail can be sent whenever any of them cease to validate
            </li>
            <li>
              Right now someone could probably use the existing URL-minder
              service instead of writing a new one (tell it to "mind" the URL
              that points to the validation result for a page?) But I'm not sure
              how regularly URL-minder checks for changes; it seemed to be
              weekly or something, which isn't frequent enough, IMO. Doing an
              If-Modified-Since GET every day doesn't cost much if pages don't
              change. Some of these features should only be enabled if the page
              consistently returns a Last-Modified header, maybe.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Add an HTML pretty-printer feature, using
          <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy/">tidy</a>?
        </li>
        <li>Provide messages in different languages?</li>
        <li>
          Add a graphical representation of the document's structure,
          using GIFs-mixed-with-text, or an entire GIF?
        </li>
        <li>Add a section with PICS info?</li>
        <li>
          Issue PICS labels for documents that do/don't conform?
          Or for editing tools that don't conform?
        </li>
        <li>Add support for https:// (TLS/SSL).</li>
        <li>
          Figure out what's going on with <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-validator/2001JanMar/0150.html">this</a>.

          Thanks Clemens!)
        </li>
        <li>
          Double check that all output is valid! In particular, use style rules
          to specify heigth/width on suggested links.
        </li>
        <li>
          Write documentation for the SGML catalog, point out good DOCTYPEs to use,

        </li>
        <li>
          Investigate validation of <a href="http://www.openhealth.org/RDDL/">RDDL</a>.

        <li>
          Fix directories differing only in name case in

        <li>
          Add system requirements for NT/W2K. Bug Bjoern about his "Installing the

        </li>
        <li>
          Do a great big update of the various badges; the details of size,
          transparency, naming, and how they are linked to (v.w3.org vs. w3.org).
        </li>
        <li>Make sure we output sane "text/html; charset=foo".</li>
